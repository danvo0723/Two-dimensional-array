# Simple Java Programming practice
# Two-dimensional-array

Purpose: 
Declare a two-dimensional array of ints in main.
Write a static method to read in the size of each dimension, allocate memory for the array and return it.
Write another static method to initialize each element to the row index*10 + column index
(for example, the element at [3][4] would have the value 34).
Call those methods in main.
